Goodbye Green is a Texture Pack for Geometry Dash that replaces (most) of the game's buttons with a red color scheme, instead of green.

HOW TO USE:
1. Install Geode, Geometry Dash's mod client at https://geode-sdk.org/
2. After Geode is installed, find the mod 'Texture Loader' from the mod index
3. Restart your game after installing the mod and you will see a folder icon on the game's main page
4. Click the folder button, and it will open a menu. Click the other folder button in the bottom right corner and create a file folder named 'packs'.
5. Download goodbyegreen.zip into this folder and extract it
6. Select the texture pack in the menu from step 4
7. You're done!

COMPATIBLE WITH:
1. cvolton's BetterInfo mod
2. Polsk's Level Quests mod
3. Dankmeme's Globed mod

In order to replace the mod textures, you must go into this directory:
C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Geometry Dash\geode\unzipped
In this folder, you will find your downloaded mods and can replace each file yourself.
